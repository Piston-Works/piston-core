# Piston Core

*In active development, not ready for use yet!*

Piston Core is a cross-platform API for building Minecraft server-side mods/plugins.

The goal is to provide a unified API that works across different server software, even modded software like Fabric and
Forge, for creating server-side plugins (and mods that act like plugins).

## Supported platforms

- [x] Spigot/any Spigot fork
- [ ] Fabric (planned)
- [ ] Forge (planned)
- [ ] NeoForge (planned)
- [ ] Velocity (planned)
- [ ] BungeeCord (planned)
- [ ] Folia (planned)

## What's not supported

- [ ] Client side mods
- [ ] Hybrid server software (e.g. Mohist, SpongeForge, etc.)

## Supported use cases

- ✅ Creating custom commands
- ✅ Listening for events
- ✅ Almost anything you could do with a Spigot plugin
- ❌ This is **not** a modding framework, so you cannot create custom blocks, items, entities, etc.
